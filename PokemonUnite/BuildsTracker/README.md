## The idea behind this project

The Pokémon Unite Build Tracker is a game-changing tool that lets players test out different battle item combinations before stepping into the arena. Each item boosts a Pokémon's stats, providing crucial advantages in matches, and with each Pokémon allowed only three items, choosing the right mix can make all the difference. This tracker offers a sandbox for players to experiment with these power-ups, simulating how they enhance a Pokémon's abilities in various battle scenarios. It's about crafting the perfect setup to maximize each Pokémon's potential, ensuring you go into each game with a strategy poised to dominate.

This tracker simplifies the art of build optimization. By allowing players to predict and understand the impact of each item combination, the tool empowers them to make informed strategic decisions. It’s more than just preparation—it’s about gaining a competitive edge.
